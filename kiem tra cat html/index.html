				<a id="tieude" href="">Scenario</a>
				<p>After my divorce I felt very lonely because a lot of our friends in Beijing were from my wife’s side. I ended up in a foreign country with almost no friends. At first I only spent time with my colleagues, but a little after I started to look for an app that can help me find new buddies to hang out.</p>
